The most common complications include:\nDiabetic neuropathy is a nerve damage caused by diabetes. This condition is caused by the high blood sugar levels. The high blood sugar damages the nerves and the blood vessels. This patchy damage causes numbness and tingling in the feet and hands. This condition can be very painful and can even lead to amputations.\nDiabetic neuropathy is more common in people who have been suffering from diabetes for a long period of time. It is also more common in people who have poorly controlled blood sugar levels.\nDiabetic neuropathy is a serious condition that can lead to amputations and other serious complications.

    "generated_text": "Kubernetes can be used for more than just container orchestration. The platform also offers a variety of features that make it an attractive choice for building highly available systems. In this article, we’ll explore how Kubernetes can be used to build highly available systems and how it compares to other options.\nWhat is Kubernetes and how does it work?\nKubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes allows developers to easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It is also highly fault-tolerant, making it an ideal choice for building highly available systems.\nKubernetes offers a variety of features that make it an attractive choice for building highly available systems. These features include:\nKubernetes is highly fault-tolerant. This means that if one node in the cluster goes down, the system will continue to run.\nKubernetes is highly scalable. This means that you can easily add or remove nodes from the cluster as needed.\nKubernetes is highly available. This means that if one node in the cluster goes down, the system will continue to run.\nKubernetes is highly secure. This means that your data is protected from unauthorized access.\nKubernetes is highly efficient. This means that your system will use less resources and run faster.\nKubernetes is highly customizable. This means that you can easily configure the platform to meet your specific needs.\nKubernetes is highly reliable. This means that your system will always be available.\nKubernetes is highly portable. This means that you can easily move your system from one environment to another.\nKubernetes is highly cost-effective.
